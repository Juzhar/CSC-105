I made my name in bold and in a bigger font size so it can stand out compared to everything else
I made the subheadings bigger and underlined as I thought they were too small and too unnoticeable
I made the table section a different color to make the table easier to understand
I made all the images centered as it looked better that way
I made my name in purple to match the color of Carlow
I made the main background color grey because it looks sleek that way
